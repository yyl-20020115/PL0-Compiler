# PL0-Compiler

This is the wellknown compiler for PL/0 programming language which is a subset of Pascal.

You would have already read the pure c version on your textbook of "Compilers".

I just simply made project of the source code both in form of Visual Studio project and CMakeLists.txt.
And an upgrade version in C++ which is easier to read and use (maybe add more syntax or function as you wish).

NOTICE:
Here we use "<>" as not-equals-to, instead of the "#" sign.
and we use "/* */" for comment and not "{}".

More details, please read the code.
